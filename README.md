# Telegram Crypto Wallet


The Telegram Crypto Wallet tracker is a Python application that allows users to track cryptocurrency wallets for various blockchains and sends notifications on Telegram when a transaction is made.

The application provides a convenient way for users to add, remove, and list their cryptocurrency wallets. It supports popular blockchains such as WAX, BSC (Binance Smart Chain), and ETH (Ethereum).

When a new transaction occurs in any of the tracked wallets, the application sends a notification message to the user's Telegram chat, providing details about the transaction.

This wallet tracking solution is designed to keep users informed about their cryptocurrency transactions and provide a seamless experience for managing multiple wallets across different blockchains.
